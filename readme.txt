This code snippet allows you to embed a telnet client or server easily into any
of your applications.  Currently this code only builds for Windows and the XBOX.
It is very desirable to me to have this code build for APPLE, Linux, and Iphone
If you wish to contribute to this cause, please let me know and I will add you
as a developer to the google code page.  http://code.google.com/p/telnet

To test the program simply run 'telnet.exe'.

The first time you run it, it will be set up as a telnet server.  You can
connect to it by runing a telnet client and typing 'open localhost 23'
If you run the program a second time, it will detect that a server is already
using Port 23 and will instead start up as a client.  You can now send messages
between the two instances of the application.
You can keep launching as many of them as you wish.
